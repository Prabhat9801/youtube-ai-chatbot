AI: Based on the video transcript, there are three main types of machine learning discussed:

## Main Types of Machine Learning

1. **Supervised Learning**
   - Uses labeled training data
   - Examples: Classification and regression

2. **Unsupervised Learning**
   - Finds patterns in unlabeled data
   - Examples: Clustering and dimensionality reduction

3. **Reinforcement Learning**
   - Learns through interaction with environment
   - Uses rewards and penalties to improve performance
```

## ⚙️ Configuration Options

### Backend Configuration (`backend/config.py`)

```python
# RAG System Settings
CHUNK_SIZE = 500              # Text chunk size for processing
CHUNK_OVERLAP = 50            # Overlap between chunks
SIMILARITY_SEARCH_K = 4       # Number of similar chunks to retrieve

# AI Model Settings
MODEL_NAME = "gemini-1.5-flash"  # Gemini model version
TEMPERATURE = 0.2             # Response creativity (0.0-1.0)
MAX_TOKENS = 1000            # Maximum response length

# Vector Store Settings
EMBEDDING_MODEL = "sentence-transformers/all-MiniLM-L6-v2"
VECTOR_STORE_TYPE = "FAISS"   # Vector database type
```

### Extension Configuration (`extension/content.js`)

```javascript
// Backend API Configuration
const BACKEND_URL = 'http://localhost:5000';
const API_TIMEOUT = 30000;    // 30 seconds

// UI Configuration
const CHAT_BUTTON_POSITION = { bottom: '20px', right: '20px' };
const CHAT_WINDOW_SIZE = { width: '400px', height: '500px' };

## 🛠️ Development Guide

### Setting Up Development Environment

```bash
# Clone and setup
git clone https://github.com/Prabhat9801/youtube-ai-chatbot.git
cd youtube-ai-chatbot

# Backend development setup
cd backend
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Install development dependencies
pip install pytest flask-testing black flake8

# Set environment variables
export FLASK_ENV=development
export FLASK_DEBUG=1
```

### Running in Development Mode

```bash
# Start backend with auto-reload
cd backend
python app.py

# The server will restart automatically when you make changes
```

### Extension Development

1. **Load Extension**: Load unpacked extension in developer mode
2. **Make Changes**: Edit extension files
3. **Reload Extension**: Click reload button in chrome://extensions/
4. **Test Changes**: Refresh YouTube page and test functionality

### Testing

```bash
# Backend tests
cd backend
pytest tests/

# API endpoint testing
curl -X POST http://localhost:5000/chat \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"message": "test", "video_id": "dQw4w9WgXcQ"}'
```

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues and Solutions

#### 1. Extension Not Appearing
**Problem**: Extension doesn't show up on YouTube
**Solutions**:
```bash
# Check extension is enabled
chrome://extensions/ → Enable the extension

# Refresh YouTube page
Ctrl+F5 (Windows) / Cmd+Shift+R (Mac)

# Check console for errors
F12 → Console tab
```

#### 2. Backend Connection Errors
**Problem**: "Failed to connect to backend"
**Solutions**:
```bash
# Verify server is running
curl http://localhost:5000/status

# Check firewall settings
# Allow port 5000 in Windows Firewall

# Verify dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

#### 3. Google API Issues
**Problem**: "API key invalid" or model errors
**Solutions**:
```bash
# Verify API key
python -c "import google.generativeai as genai; genai.configure(api_key='YOUR_KEY'); print('✓ API key valid')"

# Check available models
python backend/check_models.py

# Update model name in rag_system.py
model="gemini-pro"  # Try this if gemini-1.5-flash fails
```

#### 4. No Video Transcript Available
**Problem**: "Sorry, I couldn't access the transcript"
**Solutions**:
- Ensure video has captions enabled
- Try videos with auto-generated captions
- Check if video is region-locked
- Test with popular educational videos

#### 5. Slow Response Times
**Problem**: AI responses take too long
**Solutions**:
```python
# Reduce chunk size in config.py
CHUNK_SIZE = 300
SIMILARITY_SEARCH_K = 2

# Use faster embedding model
EMBEDDING_MODEL = "all-MiniLM-L6-v2"

# Optimize temperature
TEMPERATURE = 0.1
```

### Debug Mode

Enable debug logging:

```python
# In backend/app.py
import logging
logging.basicConfig(level=logging.DEBUG)

# In extension console
localStorage.setItem('debug', 'true');
```

```

### Performance Metrics
- **Response Time**: 2-5 seconds (depending on video length)
- **Memory Usage**: ~200MB (including embeddings)
- **Accuracy**: 85-95% (based on transcript quality)
- **Supported Languages**: All languages with YouTube captions

### Current Limitations
- Requires videos with available transcripts/captions
- Responses based only on audio content (no visual analysis)
- Backend must be running for extension functionality
- API rate limits apply (Google Gemini API)
- Large videos (>2 hours) may have slower processing

### Future Enhancements
- [ ] Visual content analysis using computer vision
- [ ] Support for live streams and premieres
- [ ] Multi-language response capability
- [ ] Offline mode with cached responses
- [ ] Video timestamp navigation
- [ ] Export conversation history
- [ ] Custom AI model fine-tuning
- [ ] Team collaboration features
